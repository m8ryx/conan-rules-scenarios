Fundamental Mechanics
=====================
Fatigue
-------
Fatigue crystals are the basic currency in Conan. Each player, including the Overlord starts the game with a certain number of fatigue crystals in their reserve. Most actions require one or more crystals be removed from the Reserve Zone and be placed onto the corresponding space on the player board, or directly into Fatigue Zone. When a character takes damage, fatigue crystal are placed into the Wound Zone, from which they are not regenerated.

Actions
-----------------
Most actions cost fatigue crystals. There are several primary mechanics for taking actions. A player can perform actions in any order, and multiple times, until they have exhausted their fatigue crystals or choose to end their turn.

*Exertion Limit*

Many actions have an _exertion limit_. This is indicated in *red* in the lower left corner of the action's space on the tableau. The number of fatigue crystals played to the action during the player turn cannot exceed the exertion limit.

*Hinderance*

Hinderance is an important mechanic, reflecting the difficulty of taking actions while in conflict. For each enemy in excess of the number of allies (not counting the player) one unit of hinderance is applied to actions that can are _hinderable_. For example, Conan and Shevatas are in a room with two enemy figures. If either chooses to make a move that is hinderable, that action takes a penalty of one hinderance.

Hinderance can apply to basic actions or to rolling actions. In the both cases, deduct the hinderance from the total of that action.

*Basic actions*

Actions like movement and reroll are automatic. Pay a crystal from the Reserve Zone to the action's space on the tableau to take that action once, and pay additional crystals to take that action again. Hinderance is applied to the total number of crystals after any bonuses or other penalties have been applied.

*Rolling actions*

Actions like _attack_ and _manipulate_ are rolling actions. For each crystal applied to that action, add one of that die color to the action's pool. Hinderance is applied to the total shown on the the dice, after rerolls have been applied.

Most the actions on the player board and Book of Skelos are stackable
